# Openscop

Openscop is an open-source recreation of Petscop built in Godot 4.1.1 that is meant to be used as a tool for people who are interested in producing fan content about Petscop, such as Petscop fan games or fan videos, and that need a pre-made basis of the game to use as a foundation for their project.

This project is meant to be run on Godot 4.1.1 and is not meant to be a fully playable game or recreation. To check the credits, hold "Ctrl" while on the Garalina logo screen.
