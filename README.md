# Openscop

Openscop is an open-source recreation of Petscop built in Godot 4.1.1 that is meant to be used as a tool for people who are interested in producing fan content about Petscop, such as Petscop fan games or fan videos, and that need a pre-made basis of the game to use as a foundation for their project.

This project is meant to be run on Godot 4.1.1, however it is fully compatible with newer versions. This project is not meant to be a fully playable game or recreation. To check the credits, hold "Ctrl" while on the Garalina logo screen.

### WARNING WHEN OPENING ON GODOT 4.2 OR NEWER
If you plan to upgrade the game to 4.2 or newer, before opening the project on the desired version, please open the project on Godot 4.1.1 first, so it can generate the cache files for the themes, preventing them from breaking once you load the project on a newer version. We are currently investigating a way to fix this without needing to load the project on an older version first.
