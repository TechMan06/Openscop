   TEXBUILD TEXTUREBUILDER V1.0
##################################

Due to textures.com's ToS, section 6.6, we are not allowed to redistribute textures.com's textures, at the same time, we want to provide people with accurate Petscop textures, for this reason, I've developed TexBuild.

TexBuild is a tool that downscales, maps, applies filters to textures.com textures that were provided by the user and saves them on Openscop' directory so they can be used in-game.

           HOW TO USE
##################################

Once the program is opened, 2 windows will be opened:
	- A Window asking for an Openscop folder.
	- A Windows Explorer window opened inside the input folder.

First, place all textures.com textures you've obtained into the input folder, once you're done, please select the Openscop folder using the "Provide Openscop Directory" window, make sure the focused folder is the your Openscop repository folder, after that, wait until the grass texture is visible on-screen, meaning the tool has finished generating the textures.
